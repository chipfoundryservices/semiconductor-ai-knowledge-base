Technology Roadmap

Process Node Timeline

| Year | TSMC | Intel |

| 2023 | N3 (3nm) | Intel 4 |
| 2024 | N3E, N3P | Intel 3 |
| 2025 | N2 (2nm) - GAA | 18A (1.8nm) - GAA + PowerVia |

| 2027 | N2X | - |
| 2028-29 | A14 (1.4nm) | 14A |

Transistor Technology Evolution

Both companies are transitioning from FinFET to Gate-All-Around (GAA):

GAA Advantage = \begincases
Better electrostatic control \\
Reduced leakage current \\
Higher drive current per area
\endcases

TSMC N2 Specifications

- Transistor Density Increase: +15% vs N3E
- Performance Gain: +10-15% @ same power
- Power Reduction: -25-30% @ same performance
- Architecture: Nanosheet GAA

\Delta P_power = -\left(\fracP_{N3E - P_N2}P_N3E\right) \times 100\% \approx -25\% to -30\%

Intel 18A Specifications

- Architecture: RibbonFET (GAA variant)
- Unique Feature: PowerVia (Backside Power Delivery Network)
- Target: Competitive with TSMC N2/A16

PowerVia Advantage:

Signal Routing Efficiency = \fracAvailable Metal Layers (Front)Total Metal Layers \uparrow

By moving power delivery to the backside:

Interconnect Density_18A > Interconnect Density_N2

Manufacturing Process Comparison

Yield Rate Analysis

Yield rate ($Y$) is critical for profitability:

Y = \fracGood DiesTotal Dies \times 100\%

Current Status (2025):

| Process | Company | Yield Status |

| N2 | TSMC | Production-ready (~85-90% mature) |
| 18A | Intel | ~10% (risk production, improving) |

Defect Density Model (Poisson):

Y = e^-D \cdot A

Where:
- $D$ = Defect density (defects/cm²)
- $A$ = Die area (cm²)

For a given defect density, larger dies have exponentially lower yields.

Wafer Cost Economics

Cost per Transistor Scaling:

Cost per Transistor = \fracWafer CostTransistors per Wafer

Transistors per Wafer = \fracWafer Area \times YDie Area \times Transistor Density

Approximate Wafer Costs (2025):

| Node | Wafer Cost (USD) |

| N3/3nm | ~$20,000 |
| N2/2nm | ~$30,000 |
| 18A | ~$25,000-30,000 (estimated) |

AI & HPC Market Impact

AI Chip Manufacturing Dominance

TSMC manufactures virtually all leading AI accelerators:

Advanced Packaging: The New Battleground

TSMC CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate):

HBM Bandwidth = Memory Channels \times Bus Width \times Data Rate

For NVIDIA H100:

Bandwidth_H100 = 6 \times 1024 bits \times 3.2 Gbps = 3.35 TB/s

Intel Foveros & EMIB:

- Foveros: 3D face-to-face die stacking

Mathematical Appendix

Moore's Law Scaling

Traditional Moore's Law:

N(t) = N_0 \cdot 2^t/T

Where:
- $N(t)$ = Transistor count at time $t$
- $N_0$ = Initial transistor count
- $T$ = Doubling period (~2-3 years)

Current Reality:

T_effective \approx 30-36 months \quad (slowing)

Dennard Scaling (Historical)

Power Density = C \cdot V^2 \cdot f

Where:
- $C$ = Capacitance (scales with feature size)
- $V$ = Voltage
- $f$ = Frequency

Post-Dennard Era:

Dennard scaling broke down ~2006. Power density no longer constant:

\fracd(Power Density)d(Node) > 0 \quad (increasing)

Amdahl's Law for Heterogeneous Computing

S = \frac1(1-P) + \fracPN

Where:
- $S$ = Speedup
- $P$ = Parallelizable fraction
- $N$ = Number of processors/accelerators

This drives demand for specialized AI chips (GPUs, TPUs) manufactured primarily by TSMC.
